Independent JPEG Group's JPEG software release 6b

This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group's JPEG software release 6b ("LIBJPEG"). LIBJPEG was used to implement the decoding of JPEG format files in Java (TM). The Content does NOT include any portion of the LIBJPEG file ansi2knr.c.

Your use of LIBJPEG is subject to the terms and conditions located in the about_files/IJG_README file which is included with the Content.

The IJG's website is located at http://ijg.org.

The following changes were made to the LIBJPEG code in the Content:

    In Java, pointer math is not allowed so indexing was used instead.
    Function pointers were replaced with switch statements.
    The virtual memory, tracing and progress monitoring were removed.
    The error handling was simplified and now uses Java exceptions.
