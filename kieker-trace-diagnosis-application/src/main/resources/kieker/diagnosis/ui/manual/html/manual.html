	<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
	
	<i>Kieker Trace Diagnosis</i> is a tool that has been developed to tabularly prepare <i>Kieker</i> monitoring logs and make them searchable.
	A focus has been put on memory usage and performance, which means that bigger logs in the range of several million method calls can still be opened.
	
	<h2 id="requirementsAndInstallation">Requirements and Installation</h2>
	
		The following requirements are necessary to use <i>Kieker Trace Diagnosis</i>.
		<ul>
			<li>Windows or Linux</li>
			<li>Java Runtime Environment 8 Update 60 or higher</li>
		</ul>
		
		The usage of Oracle's JDK for the tool is recommended.
		The troubleshooting for the usage of OpenJDK can be found in section <a href="#OpenJDK">OpenJDK</a>.
		The memory usage of the tool depends on the size of the monitoring logs.
		As guideline it is recommended to provide twice the size of the monitoring logs.</br></br>

  		For the installation, it is only necessary to unpack the archive <i>Kieker Trace Diagnosis-${version}-linux.tgz</i>, respectively <i>Kieker Trace Diagnosis-${version}-windows.zip</i>, into an abritary folder.
  		The application can subsequently be started with the star script <i>start.sh</i>, respectively <i>start.bat</i>, in the folder <i>bin</i>.
  		The application should have write permissions for the folder from which it has been started.

	<h2 id="license">License</h2>

	<h2 id="views">Views</h2>

		<h3>Traces</h3>
			This tab shows the single traces of the monitoring logs.
			Incomplete traces are not shown here.
			This view allows to search for various parameters. 
			Per default the filter is only applied on the top method call, which is the root node of the trace.
			If necessary, the search can be widened to the whole trace by using the checkbox "Search in the whole trace".
			If the checkbox "Search with regular expressions" is active, the filter masks "host", "class", "method", and "exceptions" can be filled with regular expressions with the default Java syntax.
			
		<h3>Method Calls</h3>
			This tab shows the single method calls of the monitoring logs.
			Ignored methods and methods of incomplete traces are not shown.
			This view allows to search for various parameters.
			If the checkbox "Search with regular expressions" is active, the filter masks "host", "class", "method", and "exceptions" can be filled with regular expressions with the default Java syntax.
			
		<h3>Aggregated Method Calls</h3>
			This tab shows the method calls of the monitoring logs in aggregated form.
			Methods with identical host, class, method, and exception are combined to a single aggregated method call.
			Ignored methods and methods of incomplete traces are not shown.
			This view allows to search for various parameters.
			If the checkbox "Search with regular expressions" is active, the filter masks "host", "class", "method", and "exceptions" can be filled with regular expressions with the default Java syntax.
	
		<h3>Statistics</h3>
			This tab shows various statistics for the imported monitoring logs and the application.
			The current (heap) memory usage of the application can be seen here as well.
			
	<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
	
			The settings allow to configure the tool.
			</br></br>
			The point "Appearance" allows to perform settings which has direct influence on the visual representation of the data.
			For instance, the time unit or the representation of method calls can be changed.
			The checkbox "Show non-monitored time" shows the time in the trace which has been used in the method call, but cannot be break down in detail due to missing monitoring.
			</br></br>
			With the help of the point "Aggregate method calls in traces" method calls can be combined in traces.
			This is useful if a trace has several thousand method calls, but, for instance, only the slowest are important.
			It can be choosen from various aggregation types.
	
	<h2 id="monitoringSettings">Monitoring Settings</h2>
	
			The monitoring settings can be used to enable and configure the monitoring for <i>Kieker Trace Diagnosis</i>.
			Generally speaking this is only useful for the development of <i>Kieker Trace Diagnosis</i> or for teaching purposes.
			The logs from this monitoring can be opened with the tool as well.
	
	<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
	  
		<h3 id="OpenJDK">Usage of OpenJDK</h2>
  			The usage of OpenJDK instead of Oracle's JDK is basically possible.
  			However, it can be necessary to install OpenJFX explicitly.

		<h3>Unable to create file logs/Kieker Trace Diagnosis.log</h3>
  			If this error message appears during the start, it is very likely that <i>Kieker Trace Diagnosis</i> does not have write permissions in the current working directory.
  			In this case the application can not write any log files, but can be used as usual.

		<h3>OutOfMemoryError</h3>
			If an <i>OutOfMemoryError</i> is raised while using the tool, the monitoring logs are to big to be loaded by <i>Kieker Trace Diagnosis</i>.
			In this case the parameter <i>-Xmx</i> in the start script should be set to a higher value.
